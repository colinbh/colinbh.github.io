                    During the sprint, the team's main accomplishment was deploying the web app. 
                    Before this, we improved mobile responsiveness and added important text, like for refunds, resizes, and so on. 
                    After deployment, we fixed bugs that we did not expect to happen in the transition from our local hosts. 
                    To solve them, we went through every page to see if features would break. 
                    Once these were fixed, we presented the web app to the department advisory board.

                    My focus for the sprint was to finish the shopping cart, the landing page, and to refactor my code. 
                    The shopping cart used query strings to add items, which meant that if the user reloaded the page, another item would be unintentionally added. 
                    The issue was fixed by using a RedirectToAction, so that when the cart view was called with a query, it would add the data to the user's cookies, then redirect to a plain cart view without the string. 
                    The landing page's jewelry carousels were updated by switching to Bootstrap carousels from my custom Javascript slider. 
                    Responsiveness was a problem after the switch, as the number of cards displayed would not change at different device sizes. 
                    To mitigate issues on mobile devices, I changed the carousel to display the jewelry cards in a column instead of a row on smaller screens. 
                    Some of the code for my pages was refactored to make it easier to edit repeated code. 
                    Most of the for loops were replaced with foreach loops to help avoid issues with index out-of-bounds errors, too.

                    The sprint went smoothly for the most part. 
                    Deployment was easy, and none of the bugs we encountered from it were challenging to handle. 
                    Transitioning from my custom Javascript jewelry slider to the Bootstrap carousel was also simple for the most part, and resulted in cleaner code. 
                    There were no issues during this sprint of the project either.
