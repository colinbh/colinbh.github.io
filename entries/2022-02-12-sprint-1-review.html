                    After the teams had been merged to work together on the client's product, we managed to complete most of the required sprint tasks quickly. 
                    The project notebook and the development presentation were both finished on the day of the project notebook deadline. 
                    While we were discussing the guidelines for these assignments, we also managed to decide on a set of common technologies and architecture that we could use in the future, which is ahead of the schedule prescribed by the development life cycle.
                    There were not any major issues during the sprint, either. 
                    The main issue that I believe could happen in the future is in delegating tasks. 
                    Currently, the team roles are quite flexible. 
                    This may result in some team members working on front-end, back-end, and database tasks at the same time, which could be confusing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On an individual level, there were not many improvements or issues either. 
                    For the project notebook, I incorporated suggestions for the project notebooks in CIT 255 and for the networking project from CIT 213. 
                    Doing so improved the consistency of the formatting and layout for this project's notebook, especially in the cases of headings and tables.

                    Overall, the majority of the sprint went well. 
                    The team was able to receive a good amount of information from the discussion with the product owner, which has helped to clear up expectations for project features and services. 
                    This has made the planning phase and the analysis phase for the project a much simpler task than it would have been otherwise.
