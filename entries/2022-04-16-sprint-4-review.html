                    The team improved upon the page designs. 
                    We had a short discussion that resulted in a design agreement. 
                    Pages were meant to have consistent headings, colors, and layouts. 
                    After this, we had a page critique session. 
                    Team members added most of these critiques to their pages in time for the sprint review. 
                    Additionally, we tried to connect the shopping cart to the Stripe checkout. 
                    I forgot to test for some potential bugs with the shopping cart. 
                    The checkout and my shopping cart design were added in too close to the sprint deadline, as well. 
                    As a result, there was not enough time to check for issues with their implementation.

                    I improved the responsiveness of the layout and the landing page. 
                    I added new hover feedback styles to the stylesheet. 
                    The product sliders on the landing page were also redeveloped. 
                    One issue is with their responsiveness. 
                    When the user clicks a slider button, the cards move the same distance at any viewport width. 
                    Due to this, an incorrect number of cards may be displayed at some screen sizes. 
                    This could be solved by recalculating the movement distance based on the column size of the cards and the width of the viewport. 
                    I developed the shopping cart functionality, too, which stores product IDs in local cookies. 
                    When the user would try to add an item to their cart, it would not appear in the shopping cart view when the user was redirected to the page. 
                    This was because the view would try to set the local cookie and then update the cookie during the same HTTP request, which is not possible. 
                    To fix this, I changed it so that if a user accessed the details page, a cookie was set. 
                    The cookie would then properly update when the user was redirected to the shopping cart.

                    The sprint was okay for the most part. 
                    Designing new pages was effortless because of the development of the stylesheet during the third sprint. 
                    It was fairly easy to fix pages based on the critiques given, too. The main problem was time management. 
                    The tasks for the checkout and shopping cart should have been due on the Thursday before the sprint deadline. 
                    I should have also worked more on the project over the holiday break.
